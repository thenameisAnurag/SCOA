### 1. **Theory**

**Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** is a nature-inspired optimization technique based on the social behavior of birds flocking or fish schooling. It is used to solve optimization problems by having a group of candidate solutions (particles) move around the solution space to find the best solution.

#### **Why PSO Works?**
- **Exploration**: Particles explore the solution space by following their own best position and the group's best position.
- **Adaptation**: Each particle updates its position and velocity based on feedback (how good its current position is).
- **Optimization**: Over time, particles converge to the best solution.

### 2. **Real-Life Use Case: Warehouse Layout Optimization**

Imagine a warehouse where stations (e.g., shelves, packing areas, or workstations) must be positioned optimally to minimize the average distance to specific target locations (e.g., delivery areas or pickup points). This minimizes travel time, increases efficiency, and reduces operational costs.

- **Stations**: Physical locations that need optimization (e.g., shelves, workstations).
- **Targets**: Desired positions or areas where items need to be moved.
- **Goal**: Minimize the total distance between stations and their targets.

### 3. **Code Explanation (Beginner-Friendly)**

---

#### **Define the Problem**
```python
class WarehouseOptimization:
    def __init__(self, warehouse_size, n_stations):
        self.warehouse_size = warehouse_size  # Size of the warehouse (width, height)
        self.n_stations = n_stations  # Number of stations (e.g., shelves, workstations)
        self.stations = np.random.rand(n_stations, 2) * warehouse_size  # Random station positions
        self.targets = np.random.rand(n_stations, 2) * warehouse_size  # Random target positions
```

- **`warehouse_size`**: Represents the dimensions of the warehouse (e.g., 100x100 units).
- **`n_stations`**: Number of stations to optimize (e.g., shelves or workstations).
- **`stations`**: Initial random positions of the stations within the warehouse.
- **`targets`**: Desired positions for the stations.

#### **Evaluate Fitness**
```python
    def evaluate(self, positions):
        """
        Evaluate the fitness of the given positions of the stations.
        Fitness is defined as the average distance between stations and their targets.
        """
        distances = np.sqrt(((positions - self.targets) ** 2).sum(axis=1))
        return np.mean(distances)
```

- **`positions`**: Current positions of the stations.
- **`distances`**: Calculates the Euclidean distance between each station and its corresponding target.
- **`return`**: The fitness value is the average distance across all stations.

---

#### **Define Particles**
```python
class Particle:
    def __init__(self, n_stations, warehouse_size):
        self.position = np.random.rand(n_stations, 2) * warehouse_size  # Random station positions
        self.velocity = np.random.randn(n_stations, 2) * 0.1  # Small random initial velocity
        self.best_position = self.position.copy()
        self.best_score = float('inf')  # Initialize best score to infinity
```

- **`position`**: Represents the current positions of a particle's stations.
- **`velocity`**: Rate of movement of the particle in the solution space.
- **`best_position`**: The best position the particle has found so far.
- **`best_score`**: The fitness score of the `best_position`.

---

#### **PSO Algorithm**
```python
def pso_warehouse_optimization(warehouse, n_particles=20, n_iterations=100, w=0.5, c1=1.5, c2=1.5):
    particles = [Particle(warehouse.n_stations, warehouse.warehouse_size) for _ in range(n_particles)]
    global_best_position = particles[0].position.copy()
    global_best_score = float('inf')
```

- **`particles`**: A swarm of particles, each representing a candidate solution.
- **`global_best_position`**: The best overall position among all particles.
- **`global_best_score`**: The fitness score of the `global_best_position`.

---

#### **Evaluate Particles**
```python
        for particle in particles:
            score = warehouse.evaluate(particle.position)

            # Update personal best
            if score < particle.best_score:
                particle.best_score = score
                particle.best_position = particle.position.copy()

            # Update global best
            if score < global_best_score:
                global_best_score = score
                global_best_position = particle.position.copy()
```

1. **Evaluate Fitness**:
   - Calculate the fitness (average distance) for each particle.
2. **Personal Best**:
   - Update the particle's `best_position` and `best_score` if the current position is better.
3. **Global Best**:
   - Update the swarm's `global_best_position` if the particle's fitness is better than the global best.

---

#### **Update Velocity and Position**
```python
        for particle in particles:
            r1, r2 = np.random.rand(2)  # Random coefficients
            cognitive = c1 * r1 * (particle.best_position - particle.position)
            social = c2 * r2 * (global_best_position - particle.position)
            particle.velocity = w * particle.velocity + cognitive + social
            particle.position += particle.velocity

            # Ensure particles stay within warehouse bounds
            particle.position = np.clip(particle.position, 0, warehouse.warehouse_size)
```

- **Cognitive Component (`c1`)**: Encourages particles to move towards their own `best_position`.
- **Social Component (`c2`)**: Encourages particles to move towards the swarm's `global_best_position`.
- **Update Velocity**: Combines the particle's momentum, cognitive component, and social component.
- **Update Position**: Moves the particle based on its velocity.
- **Bounds Check**: Ensures particles remain within the warehouse boundaries.

---

#### **Run the Algorithm**
```python
    if iteration % 10 == 0:
        print(f"Iteration {iteration}: Best score = {global_best_score:.4f}")
```

- Every 10 iterations, print the current `global_best_score` to track progress.

---

#### **Visualization**
```python
plt.scatter(warehouse.targets[:, 0], warehouse.targets[:, 1], c='blue', label='Targets', s=100)
plt.scatter(best_positions[:, 0], best_positions[:, 1], c='red', label='Optimized Stations', s=100)
for i in range(n_stations):
    plt.plot([warehouse.targets[i, 0], best_positions[i, 0]],
             [warehouse.targets[i, 1], best_positions[i, 1]], 'k--', alpha=0.5)
```

- **Blue Points**: Target positions.
- **Red Points**: Optimized station positions found by PSO.
- **Dashed Lines**: Distances between optimized stations and targets.

---

### **Example Output**

1. **Before Optimization**:
   - Stations are randomly placed in the warehouse.
2. **After Optimization**:
   - Stations are closer to their targets, reducing the total travel distance.
